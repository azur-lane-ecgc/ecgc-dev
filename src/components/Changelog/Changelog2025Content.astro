  What happened between the previous update and these updates?
</h2>

<p>
  I (the author of the guides) was very busy with my personal life, and the
  refactoring of this website. As such, the site was not updated in these 9
  months. Thank you for sticking with ECGC through these difficult times, and I
  will try to update more often in the future!
</p>
