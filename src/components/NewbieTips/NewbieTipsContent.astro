<h2 id="avoid_yt_guides">Avoid YouTube Guides</h2>
<HR />
<p>
  A majority of YouTube guides are often outdated, contain misinformation,
  and/or clickbait for views (or all of the above). Your best sources of
  information will come from Azur Lane Discord Servers, and/or people who
  actually play the game. Good Discord servers for help are Azur Lane Official,
  English Community Tier List, and English Community Guide Compendium.

<h2 id="mail">Mail is a Bank!</h2>
<HR />
<p>
  When you claim Mail Rewards, all Oil and Coin rewards are stored inside Mail
  Storage. The Mail Storage caps are 600K for Oil and 1.8M for Coins
  respectively.
  <b>Leave ALL Oil / Coins inside Mail Storage until you need it</b>. This helps
  prevent your
  <WikiLink page="Living Area#Canteen and Merchant"
    >Canteen and Merchant</WikiLink

  from filling up. You can withdraw from the Mail Storage as needed.

<h2 id="permanent_ur">Permanent URs are a TRAP!</h2>

</p>

<p>
  Do not pull only for the permanent URs as you will be able to get them
  indirectly from events. By pulling on the permanent pools. you will wastefully
  deplete your cubes and you won't have enough cubes to pull the new few events.
  The permanent UR pity allows you to select a UR after 200 pulls and these
  pulls
  <b><u>include non-UR EVENT banners</u></b>. Ideally you would want to only
  pull during events and you will get the permanent URs for free.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you do get a UR ship (either from events or permanent banners), she is
  not useful until she is max limit broken. This is because non-MLB ships are
  worse than most every other ship in the game.

  <p>
    You buy one of the ships per rarity, then refresh the shop using Guild Coins
    (top right), then buy the other two missing ships. You will be using these
    ships (except
    <WikiLink page="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</WikiLink>) for the majority of
    the game!
  </p>

  <p>
    You should have
    <WikiLink page="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</WikiLink>
    as the Flagship (middle slot),
    <WikiLink page="Portland">Portland</WikiLink>
    as the Tank (left slot). It is highly recommended to use your starter for rookie
    missions as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Depending on when you start and/or what rate-up ships you pulled for, you
    might have better options than the ones listed. In that case, you can
    replace
    <WikiLink page="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</WikiLink>
    or
    <WikiLink page="Enterprise">Enterprise</WikiLink>. Try not to use too many
    high-rarity ships, as SR Bulins are very scarce early on.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not have
    <WikiLink page="Enterprise">Enterprise</WikiLink>, you can use any other
    ship available as filler.

  <h3 id="fleet_positionings">Fleet Positionings</h3>
  <p>
    Positions in a fleet matter, as different positions take more damage or
    affect ship barrage placement.
  </p>
  <p>Specifically, these two positions are the most important:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Flagship:</b> The Flagship is the middle slot in your Main Fleet (gold-colored
        square). This slot is almost always a BB, as BBs can use their Secondary
        Guns to deal with Suicide / Ramming enemies. Many BBs have barrages that
        require this position to deal their maximum damage output, and will deal
        significantly less damage when not in this slot.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Main Tank:</b> The Main Tank is the left-most slot in your Vanguard Fleet.
        This slot is prioritized for the tankiest ship in your Vanguard since the
        slot takes the most damage in the fleet.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <h3 id="faction_fleets">Faction Fleets SUCK</h3>
  <p>Faction fleets have a lot of downsides, most notably:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Often, they require significantly more Bulin investment when compared to
        other fleet types, slowing down progression.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There are no special bonuses or synergy from running ships from the same
        faction together.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All currently existing Faction buffers are so bad that you get more
        benefit running a Good ship instead of a ship purely for the Faction
        buff (ex.
        <WikiLink page="Bismarck">Bismarck</WikiLink>). The good Faction bufffer
        ships are ones that don't rely on their Faction buff to be good (ex.
        <WikiLink page="Richelieu">Richelieu</WikiLink>).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <h2 id="push_campaign">Push Campaign</h2>
  <HR />
  <p>
    Your first objective (besides event grinding) is to push to
    <WikiLink page="Chapter 9">Chapter 9</WikiLink>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <WikiLink page="Chapter 9">Chapter 9</WikiLink>
        and above stages have an
        <WikiLink page="Oil Cost#Fuel Cost Limit">Oil-Cap</WikiLink>, which
        limits your fleets' oil expenditure to an amount indicated on the stage,
        massively increasing your oil economy.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <WikiLink page="Chapter 9">Chapter 9</WikiLink>
        and above stages also have Clearing Rewards, which give additional coins
        and other smaller rewards upon a stage clear, massively increasing your coin
        income.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A massive EXP gain spike occurs once you reach
        <WikiLink page="Chapter 11">11-1</WikiLink>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        On maps with an Oil-Cap: the most efficient EXP farming stages will be
        X-1, and the most efficient coin farming stages will be X-4.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once you reach
    <WikiLink page="Chapter 12">Chapter 12</WikiLink>,
    <WikiLink page="Dockyard#Cognitive Awakening">Cognitive Chips</WikiLink>
    are added to the Clearing Rewards drop pool. It is recommended to farm Chapter
    12 and above due to the scarcity of Cognitive Chips as your progress further
    into the game.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h3 id="3-4">Do not farm 3-4</h3>
  <p>
    Farming
    <WikiLink page="Akagi">Akagi</WikiLink>
    and/or
    <WikiLink page="Kaga">Kaga</WikiLink>
    may seem appealing because shiny, but it is one of the worst things a newbie
    can do.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        They have a really poor drop rate at 0.75% each and the oil spent trying
        to farm them can easily get you to mid-game.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Foxes are an expensive investment at 8 Gold Bulins total for a pair of
        mediocre ships; they require each other to get to that mediocre
        performance (each on their own are as bad as some commons), and it leads
        to a fleet imbalance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You tend to always want to use
        <WikiLink page="Unicorn">Unicorn</WikiLink>
        since she's one of the best investments for a newbie and running foxes with
        her will lead to a 3 CV fleet, which tends to die to (commonly found) suicide
        boats very easily.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>
    Any guides that suggest to farm foxes are either outdated (they weren't even
    great back in the days) and/or misleading. If you really want foxes, it is
    best to progress and come back when you can farm them with a 1-1 fleet (2
    ships).
  </p>

  <h2 id="out_of_ammo">My fleet is out of ammo!!!!</h2>

      Main Article:

  </p>

  <p>
    Your fleet can still fight with 0 ammo; they just do reduced damage. Read
    the wiki article above for more information.
  </p>

  <h2 id="limit_breaks">
    <WikiLink page="Dockyard#Limit Break">Limit Breaks</WikiLink>
  </h2>
  <HR />
  <p>
    <WikiLink page="Dockyard#Limit Break">Limit Break</WikiLink>
    ships you use <b>as soon as possible</b>. Limit breaks are massive power
    spikes for all ships, and allow for easier and faster progression.
  </p>
  <ul>

        them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Do NOT spread out Bulins on multiple ships! It is better to have 1 ship
        MLB than 4 ships at LB1.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
  <HR />

  <h3 id="avoid_farming_gear">Avoid Farming Gear</h3>
  <p>
    Gear drops in
    <WikiLink page="Campaign">Campaign</WikiLink>
    maps are horrendous. It is recommended to not farm any Campaign maps for gear
    due to their drop rates and mediocrity.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        During certain Events, the gear drop can be worthwhile to farm, but
        Event Currency is always first priority.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In Early Game, most gear is obtained from Tech Box opening. Always craft up
    Tech Boxes to at least T3 (Purple) before opening them.<br />In mid/late
    game, gear will be coming from
    <WikiLink page="Gear Lab">Gear Lab</WikiLink>
    and/or
    <WikiLink page="Operation Siren">Operation Siren</WikiLink>.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h3 id="gear_rarity">Gold Gear =/= Good</h3>
  <p>
    The rarity of gear doesn't determine its value. There are a lot of gold
    rarity equipment that are significantly worse than a more commonly available
    purple or blue gear option.<br />The equipment below will be what you are
    looking for in early game, which are all available from T3 (Purple) Tech
    Boxes.

  <h3 id="situational_gear">Gearing is situational</h3>
  <p>
    People often ask "What is BIS for X?". In this game, gearing is always
    situational. You want to gear your fleets to what you are facing.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Every weapon has a specific Ammo Modifier, which increases / decreases
        their damage against specific enemies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Click on a specific weapon category on this wiki page (<WikiLink
              page="Equipment List">Equipment List</WikiLink
            >) to roughly compare gear stats / damage / Ammo Modifiers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Skills and/or Fight Mechanics affect gearing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Ex.
            <WikiLink page="Helena">Helena</WikiLink>'s Radar Scan debuffs
            enemies on 20s intervals, so you want your Main Fleet ships' gear to
            time with Helena, instead of strictly going by pure highest damage.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Ex.
            <WikiLink page="Kearsarge">Kearsarge</WikiLink>
            wants to equip an

            or
            <WikiLink page="Northern Parliament">Northern Parliament</WikiLink>
            Aircraft, and gives great buffs for meeting that requirement, therefore
            that has higher priority over the plane's damage.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For mobbing, you want to spread out your backline damage to prevent
        overkilling and/or wasted (missed) attacks. Some ships have skills that
        reduce cooldowns or have very high reload to allow them to strike first.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A common mistake is to give your healer faster planes to get more
            heals. What actually happens is you shift your heal timing slightly
            earlier without getting an extra strike in a fight, losing a
            significant portion of the healer's damage. Because of this enemies
            have a higher chance of staying alive longer and you take more
            damage because of it, resulting in a net negative.

        The Gear acquired through this method could take upwards of up to
        <b>3+ months</b> to get through normal means, not to mention the opportunity
        cost of doing Research on other seasons.
      </p>
    </li>

    Wisdom Cubes should only be used on Event banners, indicated by the text

        you your Cube back, making it a net-zero Cube loss.

        It is not recommended to build on any other Construction Pools, even for

  <p>
    It is not recommended to reroll accounts due to the cube income being spread
    out instead of frontloaded, especially at the start of the game.

    The only exception is if you are starting during a UR event, where the UR
    ship is a rate-up ship in the Event banner.
