          While your valuable (PR4, PR5, DR) Catch-up prints are slowly trickling
          in, obtain and develop the ship from Step 2 using coins until the ship
          is development level 30. This entire process should take about 50 days
          or less, assuming you are spending 3000 <a

              from a different, less-valuable (PR1, PR2) Catch-up season, or a
              different ship from any season. Always have a ship being developed
